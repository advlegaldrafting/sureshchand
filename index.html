<h2>Why Marriage Registration Is Mandatory</h2>

<p>Marriage registration is not merely a procedural formality; it is a <strong>legally valid written proof of marriage (Marriage Certificate)</strong>. In modern legal and administrative systems, this certificate plays a vital role in establishing the marital relationship between husband and wife.</p>

<p>A marriage certificate is required for various official and legal purposes such as <strong>passport and visa applications, banking and insurance matters, government schemes, proof of spousal relationship, court cases, property rights</strong> and other legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Earlier in India, marriages—especially under <strong>Hindu marriage customs</strong>—were solemnized through religious ceremonies. However, there was no formal government record to officially establish that a particular man is the lawful husband of a woman or that a woman is the legally wedded wife of a man.</p>

<p>To address this gap, the <strong>Hindu Marriage Registration Act</strong> was introduced, which made it possible to officially register Hindu marriages and create a valid government record of marriage.</p>

<p>Over time, the legal and social requirements relating to marriage expanded significantly. Consequently, legislation was enacted to provide for <strong>marriage registration across all religions and communities</strong>, ensuring uniform legal recognition of marriages.</p>

<p>At present, <strong>marriage registration and issuance of a marriage certificate have been made compulsory for all religions</strong>. This ensures legal certainty, prevents disputes regarding marital status, and safeguards the rights and interests of both spouses.</p>

<p>Therefore, marriage registration serves not only as legal protection but also as a crucial document that affirms the validity and legality of a marital relationship.</p>
